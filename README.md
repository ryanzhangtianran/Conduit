Conduit is a collection of tools used by LittleSheep when acting as a "maid" for servers (i.e., performing server maintenance). The goal is to provide a more convenient way to maintain servers that is non-intrusive — day-to-day management is 100% SSH-based, installing nothing on the server. The optional MaidCafe Cloud layer adds a small outbound-only daemon for fleet management, alarms, and push notifications — no inbound ports required.

Built with Flutter, Conduit runs on desktop and mobile platforms alike. Inspired by the [Island](https://github.com/Solsynth/HyperNet.Surface) project's desktop-native approach, it brings the same calm, functional philosophy to server administration.

## Features

### Servers

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dashboard | Grid of server cards with live status, latency (network and SSH round-trip), load, memory, and uptime; reorder via context menu, organize into groups, tag, and customize with environment variables; pin runtimes and watched processes for a realtime multi-server overview |
| Activity | Real-time performance charts (CPU, memory, network, disk), backed by MaidCafe history when the daemon is installed |
| Terminal | Full SSH terminal with split panes, drag-and-drop tabs, command palette, right-click menu, OSC 52 clipboard support, and terminal color schemes |
| File Management | Dual-pane SFTP browser with drag-and-drop transfers, in-app editor, and keyboard shortcuts (copy/cut/paste, rename, refresh, search, delete) |
| Processes | List and kill running processes; pin and watch processes with usage history (realtime via the MaidCafe daemon) |
| Services | Systemd unit management (start/stop/enable/disable) |
| Web Servers | nginx and Caddy configuration management |
| Crontab | Edit scheduled tasks |
| Packages | Package management (apt, dnf, and more) |
| Firewall | UFW, firewalld, nftables, and iptables management |
| Port Forwarding | Local and remote tunnel configuration with saved presets that auto-start on connect |
| Proxy | Reach hosts through a per-server HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy |
| Jump Host | Reach a server through another managed server |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB: engine inspection, logical backups and restores, quick maintenance, and pgBackRest |
| Tailscale | Connect over your tailnet with an embedded node — no Tailscale app required |

### MaidCafe Cloud

- Sign in with a Solarpass account and select a workspace
- One-flow daemon setup: Conduit probes the server over SSH, installs the MaidCafe daemon, and registers it in the workspace automatically
- The daemon runs on its own — Conduit does not need to stay open — and only connects outbound, so no extra ports are opened to the internet
- Fleet view with per-daemon live metrics (load, swap, disk, network) streamed over SSE in real time
- Reusable action scripts with template variables, working directory, run-as user, environment, and per-action timeout
- Alarm thresholds evaluated locally by the daemon, surfaced as notifications
- Audit log with invocation provenance and captured output; clear and filter
- API credentials for CI/CD, scoped to daemons, hosts, and actions; the cloud webhook relay delivers invocations to daemons that poll the cloud
- Push notifications via Firebase (APNs/FCM) and the in-app Metoer feed

### Containers

- Docker and Podman container management
- Start, stop, restart, pause, kill, and remove containers
- Compose project grouping with detail view (per-service status, merged logs, lifecycle actions)
- Container image management
- Runtime installation assistance

### Projects

- Deployment project catalog
- Group compose stacks, web servers, and containers
- Import and export as TOML

### Snippets

- Create and edit reusable shell scripts
- Execute on one or more connected servers
- Streaming output with progress tracking

### Agent

- Chat with an AI agent that can operate your servers through tools
- Bring your own AI provider or use Solar Network AI
- MCP servers and reusable skills extend the agent's toolset
- Auto-discover models from your AI providers
- Proposed actions require approval (review mode) before they run
- Conversation history is stored on-device, outside the vault

### GitHub

- Sign in with device-flow authorization
- Pin repositories and follow workflow runs, pull requests, and releases
- Access tokens are stored encrypted in the vault
- GitHub tools are available to the agent

### Local MCP Server

- Expose Conduit's SSH servers, snippets, and skills to other agents on this machine through a local Model Context Protocol server
- Connect from Claude Desktop or any MCP client

### Security

- AES-GCM 256-bit encrypted credential vault
- PBKDF2 key derivation (310,000 iterations)
- Biometric unlock support
- Optional per-vault cloud sync over encrypted blobs (Solar Network)
- Encrypted backup archives (.mkb)
- GitHub access tokens encrypted in the vault

### Settings

- Theme (system/light/dark), accent color, and workspace background image
- Language (English / 简体中文)
- Terminal renderer selection (Ghostty libghostty-vt or xterm), font, and color scheme
- Connect on startup
- Hide server addresses when screen sharing or recording
- Metrics refresh intervals
- Tailscale sign-in and connection settings
- MaidCafe cloud endpoint configuration (self-hosted clouds supported)
- Cloud sync per vault, import and export of server connections
- Update release channel and check for updates via Solsynth Express

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev) installed (SDK ^3.12.2)
- For iOS App Store archives, install Zig 0.15.2 for the vendored Ghostty
  terminal library. The current Ghostty source is not compatible with Zig 0.16:
  ```bash
  brew install zig@0.15
  ```
- For Windows development, install [NASM](https://www.nasm.us) (required by `webcrypto` native assets):
  ```powershell
  winget install NASM.NASM
  ```
- For Linux development, install additional dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update -y
  sudo apt-get install -y \
    ninja-build \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    keybinder-3.0 \
    libnotify-dev
  ```

### Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run in debug mode
flutter run

# Build release version
flutter build <platform>
```

### Linux AppImage

Bundle a self-contained AppImage for Linux after building the release bundle:

```bash
flutter build linux
bash buildtools/build-appimage.sh
```

The script packs the x64 release bundle with the desktop entry and run helpers
into `Conduit-x86_64.AppImage`.

### iOS App Store Archive

The bundled Ghostty terminal library is compiled from source for iOS so the
binary is linked by Apple's linker and includes the encryption metadata
required by App Store Connect. After installing `zig@0.15`, the build hook
selects it automatically when creating an IPA:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build ipa
```

The build stops if the generated Ghostty framework lacks
`LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO_64`, preventing an invalid IPA from being produced.

### Development

After changing route annotations or Drift schema:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

Run checks before committing:

```bash
dart format lib test
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## Architecture

Features are flat and live directly under `lib/<feature>/`. The app uses:

- **Riverpod** for state management with `ConsumerWidget` for reactive views
- **auto_route** for declarative nested navigation
- **Drift** for local SQLite persistence
- **dartssh2** for SSH connections
- **island_ui_foundation** for the desktop window frame

See [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the full architecture guide.

| **State** | Riverpod + flutter_hooks |

| **Database** | Drift (SQLite) |
| **SSH** | dartssh2 |
| **Encryption** | cryptography (AES-GCM, PBKDF2) |
| **Terminal** | libghostty-vt / xterm |
| **Tailscale** | tailscale (embedded node, macOS/Linux) |

| **Firebase** | Cloud Messaging push (APNs/FCM), Analytics |
| **Updates** | solsynth_express |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol client + local server |
| **Desktop** | window_manager + island_ui_foundation |
